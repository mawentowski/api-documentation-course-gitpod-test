  title: Point of Service (POS) API
  version: '1.0'
  description: |
    A REST API to be used to create tableside and takeaway food ordering applications.

    ## Auth

    To create orders, you need to first create a user account then authenticate your user account for an access token.

    To get an access token and authenticate your requests.

    1. Create a User with **POST /users**.
    2. Pass your username and password to **POST /auth/token**.
    3. Add the access token to the authorization header of API calls to protected resources.

    ## Orders

    Orders are the heart of the API. Create an order with [POST /orders], passing order details in the JSON request body:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Benjamin",
      "table_number": 18,
      "dish_ids": [
        66e6a90a5eb1ced30f93c32a,
        66e6a90a5eb1ced30f93c31e
      ],
      "special_requests": "No peanuts",
      "scheduled at": null
    }
    ```

            Resource created successfully. The response body contains the newly created resource.

            The server logic applies to the response body as follows:

            - The default `priority` is `3` out of `5`, indicating medium priority. Restaurant staff may adjust the priority based on factors like preparation time.
            - The `status` is set to `Received`. Restaurant staff update the status as the order progresses toward completion.

        Each `ingredient_id` should refer to an ingredient currently in the system. For each ingredient, set the value of `is_essential` to `true` if the ingredient is required to prepare the dish. It's considered a best practice to ensure that each essential ingredient has a positive quantity. This helps determine if the dish should be selectable in the user interface.
